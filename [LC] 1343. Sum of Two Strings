Given you two strings which are only contain digit character. you should return the sum of each digit as string

Example
Example1:
Input:
A = "99"
B = "111"
Output: "11010"
Explanation: because 9 + 1 = 10, 9 + 1 = 10, 0 + 1 = 1,connect themï¼Œso answer is "11010"
Example2:
Input:
A = "2"
B = "321"
Output: "323"
Explanation: because 2 + 1 = 3, 2 + 0 = 2, 3 + 0 = 3, connect themï¼Œso answer is "323"
Notice
A and B are strings which are composed of numbers

class Solution:
    """
    @param A: a string
    @param B: a string
    @return: return the sum of two strings
    """
    def SumofTwoStrings(self, A, B):
        # write your code here
        len_a = len(A)
        len_b = len(B)
        
        i = len_a - 1
        j = len_b - 1
        
        result = ""
        while i >= 0 or j >= 0:
            if i >=0 and j >= 0:
                result = str(int(A[i]) + int(B[j])) + result
            elif i >= 0:
                result = A[i] + result
            elif j >= 0:
                result = B[j] + result
            i -= 1
            j -= 1
            
        return result
