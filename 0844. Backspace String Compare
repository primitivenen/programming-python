Given two strings S and T, return if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors. # means a backspace character.

Note that after backspacing an empty text, the text will continue empty.

Example 1:

Input: S = "ab#c", T = "ad#c"
Output: true
Explanation: Both S and T become "ac".
Example 2:

Input: S = "ab##", T = "c#d#"
Output: true
Explanation: Both S and T become "".
Example 3:

Input: S = "a##c", T = "#a#c"
Output: true
Explanation: Both S and T become "c".
Example 4:

Input: S = "a#c", T = "b"
Output: false
Explanation: S becomes "c" while T becomes "b".
Note:

1 <= S.length <= 200
1 <= T.length <= 200
S and T only contain lowercase letters and '#' characters.

Can you solve it in O(N) time and O(1) space?

class Solution:   
    def backspaceCompare(self, S: str, T: str) -> bool:
        i = len(S) - 1
        j = len(T) - 1
        cnt_i = 0
        cnt_j = 0
        while i >= 0 and j >= 0:
            while i >=0 and S[i] == '#':
                cnt_i += 1
                i -= 1
            while j>= 0 and T[j] == '#':
                cnt_j += 1
                j -= 1
