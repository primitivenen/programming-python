291. Second Diameter

Given a tree consisting of n nodes, n-1 edges. Output the second diameter of a tree, namely, the second largest value of distance between pairs of nodes.
Given an array edge of size (n-1) \times 3(n−1)×3, and edge[i][0], edge[i][1] and edge[i][2] indicate that the i-th undirected edge is from edge[i][0] to edge[i][1] and the length is edge[i][2].

Example
Input:[[0,1,4],[0,2,7]]
Output:7
Explanation: The second largest value of distance is 7 between node 0 and node 2.

Clarification
If there are more than one max distance, you just need to return the max distance

Using DFS(Depth-First-Search) is easy to cause stack overflow, so please use BFS(Breadth First Search) to finish the task.

解题思路：
BFS
step 1: start from any node A. use 1st BFS to find the furthest node B
step 2: start from B. use 2nd BFS to find the furthest node C and record the second longest diameter (d1)
step 3: start from C. use 3rd BFS to find the furthest node and record the second longest diameter (d2)
return max(d1, d2)
